Please don't cringe about horrible code.*<br>\r\n***You have been warned***\r\n\r\nThe idea behind KFM\r\n-------------------\r\nWhenever I've downloaded Anime episodes with uTorrent (*don't sue me*), some things bugged me.<br>\r\nSince I have a dedicated partition with all my series on it, I wanted to automate the downloading, moving and renaming of weekly series.\r\n- Automated downloading was no problem, thanks to [ShanaProject](http://www.shanaproject.com/ \"ShanaProject\").\r\n- Moving wouldn't be a problem too, since uTorrent supports moving files after they're successfully downloaded.<br>\r\n*Unfortunately, you can't rename or move them based on their name.*\r\n\r\nThe idea is now to write a program, which takes a file name and moves it based on a preconfigured regular expression into a root folder and sub folder.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\nFile name: \"[HorribleSubs] Kill la Kill - 23 [1080p].mkv\"<br>\r\nConfiguration:<br>\r\n```\r\nroot=M:\\\r\nfolder {\r\n remove \\[.*?\\]\r\n remove \\s-\\s.*\r\n trim\r\n}\r\nfile {\r\n remove \\[.*?\\]\r\n trim\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGenerated folder: \"M:\\Kill la Kill\\Kill la Kill - 23.mkv\"\r\n\r\nExpressions\r\n-----------\r\n### trim\r\nParameters: none <br>\r\nTrims all leading and trailing spaces from the filename <br>\r\n*This method ignores the file extension* <br>\r\n>Input: \" &nbsp; MyFile &nbsp; .mkv\" <br>\r\n>Output: \"MyFile.mkv\" <br>\r\n\r\n### remove\r\nParameters: one: regex <br>\r\nRemoves everything that matches the given regular expression <br>\r\n>Config: remove \\\\[.*?\\\\] <br>\r\n>Input: \"[Something]Hello_World[Different].mkv\" <br>\r\n>Output: \"Hello_World.mkv\" <br>\r\n\r\n### replace\r\nParameters: two: regex, 'value'<br>\r\nReplaces everything that matches the given regular expression with the given value <br>\r\n>Config: replace _,' ' <br>\r\n>Input: \"Hello_World.mkv\" <br>\r\n>Output: \"Hello World.mkv\" <br>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n- Custom regular expressions\r\n\r\nWhy Kongou you ask? I like the name. That's all.\r\n","google":"UA-43146106-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
