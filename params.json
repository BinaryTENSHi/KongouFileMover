Please don't cringe about horrible code.*<br>\r\n***You have been warned***\r\n\r\nThe idea behind KFM\r\n-------------------\r\nWhenever I've downloaded Anime episodes with uTorrent (*don't sue me*), some things bugged me.<br>\r\nSince I have a dedicated partition with all my series on it, I wanted to automate the downloading, moving and renaming of weekly series.\r\n- Automated downloading was no problem, thanks to [ShanaProject](http://www.shanaproject.com/ \"ShanaProject\").\r\n- Moving wouldn't be a problem too, since uTorrent supports moving files after they're successfully downloaded.<br>\r\n*Unfortunately, you can't rename or move them based on their name.*\r\n\r\nThe idea is now to write a program, which takes a file name and moves it based on a preconfigured regular expression into a root folder and sub folder.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\nFile name: \"[HorribleSubs] Kill la Kill - 23 [1080p].mkv\"<br>\r\nConfiguration:<br>\r\n```\r\nroot=M:\\\r\nfolder {\r\n remove \\[\\w*\\]\r\n remove -.*\r\n trim\r\n}\r\nfile {\r\n remove \\[\\w*\\]\r\n trim\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUsable methods:\r\n- remove\r\n- replace\r\n- trim\r\n\r\n**Extensions will be ignored**\r\n\r\nGenerated folder: \"M:\\Kill la Kill\\Kill la Kill - 23.mkv\"\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n- Custom regular expressions\r\n- Progress notifications as popups\r\n- Switch the graphic on the popup\r\n\r\nWhy Kongou you ask? I like the name. That's all.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
